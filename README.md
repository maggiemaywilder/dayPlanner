# Day Planner

KU bootcamp homework: We were tasked with creating a dayplanner which would display the current day upon opening. Aside from displaying the date at the top and input blocks for each hour during the day, each block is to be color-coded to indicate if it's in the past, future, or is the current hour. Scheduled events need to persist when the page is refreshed or reopened. 

I chose LuxonJs for the management of time because of it's connection to MomentJs.
